# Voice-Controlled-Mobile-Robot-for-Task-Execution

## Overview

This project is a voice-controlled autonomous robot that uses _ESP32_ and _Alexa. The robot can navigate via Google Maps, avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors, and handle objects with a servo mechanism_. It is designed for tasks such as home automation, industrial applications, autonomous delivery, and surveillance.

## Features

- _Voice Control:_ Integrated with _Alexa_ for remote control via voice commands.
- _Autonomous Navigation:_ Navigates using _Google Maps_ API for location-based movement.
- _Object Handling:_ Equipped with a _servo mechanism_ for precise object manipulation (picking and placing).
- _Obstacle Avoidance:_ Uses _ultrasonic sensors_ to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time.
- _IoT Connectivity:_ Built with _ESP32_ to provide cloud-based control for remote automation.

## Technologies Used

- _Microcontroller:_ ESP32/Arduino
- _Voice Recognition:_ Integrated with _Alexa_
- _Navigation:_ Utilizes _Google Maps API_
- _Sensors:_ _Ultrasonic sensors_ for obstacle avoidance
- _Camera Module:_ For path identification and real-time navigation
- _Wi-Fi Connectivity:_ For cloud-based control and remote access

## Applications

- _Home Automation:_ Control and automate household tasks via voice.
- _Industrial Automation:_ Used in factories or warehouses for handling tasks.
- _Autonomous Delivery:_ Capable of moving packages or small items automatically.
- _Surveillance:_ Can be used for security or patrol tasks in various environments.
